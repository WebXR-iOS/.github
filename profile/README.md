    Welcome to a group of people who really want to make WebXR work for iOS and also add more features at the same time.
    You could start by helping develop this project if you want or you could just give feedback after using it.
    Both would be greatly appriciated. We don't just want people on iOS however, as we want it to work for all and updating things
    can break other things, so if you own any other WebXR headset. Your help will make this project even better.
